For investigation of genetic and epigenetic regulation of human trophoblast differentiation, we have previously established human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) from first-trimester placentas. Those hTSCs were able to differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and syncytiotrophoblasts (STs), and their transcriptome was similar to that of cytotrophoblasts in human placenta. However, since HDP happens in the second half of pregnancy, the conventional hTSC derivation method was not enough to investigate the nature of HDP trophoblasts. In this analysis, we improved the derivation method and successfully established the hTSCs from normal and HDP term placentas after delivery. We performed RNA-seq of normal and HDP hTSCs, and HDP hTSCs recapitulated abnormalities in gene expression reported in HDP placentas."}, "STUDY_ATTRIBUTES": {"STUDY_ATTRIBUTE": [{"TAG": "NBDC Number", "VALUE": "hum0433"}, {"TAG": "Registration date", "VALUE": "2024-01-05"}, {"TAG": "Submitting organization", "VALUE": "Kumamoto University Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics"}, {"TAG": "Principal Investigator", "VALUE": "Hiroaki Okae"}, {"TAG": "Molecular Data Type", "VALUE": "RNA-seq"}, {"TAG": "Platform", "VALUE": "NovaSeq 6000"}, {"TAG": "Vendor", "VALUE": "Illumina"}, {"TAG": "Comment", "VALUE": null}, {"TAG": "Primary Phenotype", "VALUE": "Trophoblast stem cells derived from healthy term placentas"}, {"TAG": "Phenotype", "VALUE": "Trophoblast stem cells derived from HDP term placentas"}]}}, "identifier": "JGAS000660", "title": "Transcriptome of human trophoblast stem cells derived from normal and HDP placentas", "description": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) is a disease driven by abnormal placenta formation, which is a leading cause of maternal and fetal death.
