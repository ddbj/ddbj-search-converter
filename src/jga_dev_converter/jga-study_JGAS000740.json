In vitro host cell modeling and bacterial interactions at the anaerobic interphase have elucidated the crosstalk molecular basis. Although classical cell lines derived from patients with colorectal cancer including Caco-2 cells are used, whether they adequately mimic normal colonic epithelial physiology is unclear. To address this, we performed transcriptome profiling of Caco-2 and Monolayer cells derived from healthy Human Colonic Organoid (MHCO) cultured hemi-anaerobically. Coculture with the anaerobic gut bacteria, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum differentiated the probiotic effects of test cells from those of physiologically normal intestinal and colorectal cancer cells. We cataloged non- or overlapping gene signatures where gene profiles of Caco-2 cells represented absorptive cells in the small intestinal epithelium, and MHCO cells showed complete colonic epithelium signature, including stem/progenitor, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells colonocytes. Characteristic gene expression changes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cell-cell adhesion were observed in cocultured live Bifidobacterium longum and Caco-2 or MHCO cells. B. longum-stimulated MHCO cells exhibited barrier-enhancing characteristics, as demonstrated in clinical trials. Our data represent a valuable resource for understanding gut microbe and host cell communication."}, "GRANTS": {"GRANT": [{"grant_id": "19H03455", "TITLE": "KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research: Molecular mechanism of the colonic stem cell niche during intestinal epithelial regeneration in inflammatory bowel disease", "AGENCY": {"abbr": "JSPS", "content": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}}, {"grant_id": "23H02713", "TITLE": "KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research", "AGENCY": {"abbr": "JSPS", "content": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}}, {"grant_id": "23K17415", "TITLE": "KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research: Predictive modeling of bacteria variation using in vitro reconstructions of the human gut ecosystem", "AGENCY": {"abbr": "JSPS", "content": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}}, {"grant_id": "JP23ae0121046", "TITLE": "Development of a Scalable Platform of the Drug Discovery Targeting for Mucosal Ecosystem", "AGENCY": {"abbr": "AMED", "content": "Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development"}}]}, "STUDY_ATTRIBUTES": {"STUDY_ATTRIBUTE": [{"TAG": "NBDC Number", "VALUE": "hum0477"}, {"TAG": "Registration date", "VALUE": "2024-09-20"}, {"TAG": "Submitting organization", "VALUE": "Gunma University"}, {"TAG": "Principal Investigator", "VALUE": "Nobuo Sasaki"}, {"TAG": "Molecular Data Type", "VALUE": "Transcriptome sequencing"}, {"TAG": "Platform", "VALUE": "NextSeq1000"}, {"TAG": "Vendor", "VALUE": "Illumina"}, {"TAG": "Comment", "VALUE": null}, {"TAG": "Primary Phenotype", "VALUE": "Colon cancer"}, {"TAG": "ICD-10 Disease Classification", "VALUE": "Malignant neoplasm of colon (C18.6)"}]}}, "identifier": "JGAS000740", "title": "Transcriptome sequencing of human colon organoid after co-cultivation with Bifidobacterium longum", "description": "The large intestine has a dense milieu of indigenous bacteria, generating a complex ecosystem with crosstalk between individual bacteria and host cells.
