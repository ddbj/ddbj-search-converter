We performed cDNA amplicon sequencing for various types of mutations such as point mutations in EGFR and KRAS and oncogenic fus\n  ion transcripts in ALK and RET. Using the long reads of MinION, we also conducted mutation phasing of EGFR TKI-sensitive and resistant mutations, which would provide useful information to next thrapeutic approaches for cancers. We applied this method to identify mutation\n   genotypes of eight clinical samples from Japanese lung adenocarcinomas. This method could provide new sequencing-based diagnostic approaches for lung cancers. Additinally we also performed cancer mutation identification of risk-dependent unique samples. Usual interstiti\n  al pneumonia (UIP) is a risk factor for lung carcinogenesis. This study was performed to characterize mutagenesis and mutational target genes underlying lung carcinogenesis in patients with UIP.We performed whole exome sequencing of lung adenocarcinoma with usual interst\n  itial pneumonia."}, "PUBLICATIONS": {"PUBLICATION": {"id": "29117310", "status": "published", "DB_TYPE": "PUBMED"}}, "STUDY_ATTRIBUTES": {"STUDY_ATTRIBUTE": [{"TAG": "NBDC Number", "VALUE": "hum0068"}, {"TAG": "Registration date", "VALUE": "2016-08-16"}, {"TAG": "Submitting organization", "VALUE": "National Cancer Center Research Institute"}, {"TAG": "Principal Investigator", "VALUE": "Takashi Kono"}, {"TAG": "Molecular Data Type", "VALUE": "Amplicon Sequencing"}, {"TAG": "Molecular Data Type", "VALUE": "Whole exome sequencing"}, {"TAG": "Platform", "VALUE": "MinION"}, {"TAG": "Platform", "VALUE": "HiSeq2000"}, {"TAG": "Vendor", "VALUE": "Oxford nanopore"}, {"TAG": "Vendor", "VALUE": "Illumina"}, {"TAG": "Comment", "VALUE": null}, {"TAG": "Primary Phenotype", "VALUE": "Lung Cancer (HP:0100526)"}, {"TAG": "Phenotype", "VALUE": "Usual interstitial pneumonia (HP:0031950)"}]}}, "identifier": "JGAS000065", "title": "Sequencing cancer mutations in various types of lung cancer using the long-read, portable sequencer", "description": "In this study, we used a long-read and portable sequencer MinION to identify cancer mutations in lung adenocarcinoma cells.
