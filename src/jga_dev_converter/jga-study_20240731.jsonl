Out of 177 cases with no driver alterations detected by WES, WGS identified driver alterations in 68.4% and likely driver alterations in 22.6% of cases. The most common alterations found were oncogene amplifications, tumor suppressor gene deletions, and small variants outside coding regions. WGS proved valuable in uncovering genomic changes associated with cancer development."}, "STUDY_LINKS": {"STUDY_LINK": [{"URL_LINK": {"LABEL": "https://www.scchr.jp/project-hope.html", "URL": "https://www.scchr.jp/project-hope.html"}}, {"URL_LINK": {"LABEL": "https://www.jcga-scc.jp", "URL": "https://www.jcga-scc.jp"}}]}, "STUDY_ATTRIBUTES": {"STUDY_ATTRIBUTE": [{"TAG": "NBDC Number", "VALUE": "hum0127"}, {"TAG": "Registration date", "VALUE": "2024-05-28"}, {"TAG": "Submitting organization", "VALUE": "Shizuoka Cancer Center"}, {"TAG": "Principal Investigator", "VALUE": "Ken Yamaguchi"}, {"TAG": "Molecular Data Type", "VALUE": "Whole genome sequencing"}, {"TAG": "Platform", "VALUE": "NovaSeq 6000"}, {"TAG": "Vendor", "VALUE": "Illumina"}, {"TAG": "Comment", "VALUE": null}, {"TAG": "Primary Phenotype", "VALUE": "Cancer"}, {"TAG": "ICD-10 Disease Classification", "VALUE": "Neoplasms (C00-D48)"}, {"TAG": "method", "VALUE": "Whole genome sequencing"}, {"TAG": "method", "VALUE": "Whole exome sequencing"}, {"TAG": "method", "VALUE": "Cancer genome"}]}}}}

In this study, we conducted a single-cell RNA analysis to examine the tumor microenvironments (TME) of ACP and PCP. Single-cell clustering revealed a wide range of cell types, which were further categorized based on gene expression patterns. For ACP, these categories included developing epithelia, calcification, and immune response, while PCP showed developing epithelia, cell cycle, and immune response as prominent categories.\n\nSubclustering analysis unveiled different types of immune cells in both ACP and PCP TMEs, with specific patterns of immune responses. Interestingly, smaller tumors were associated with particular immune cell ratios.\n\nFurthermore, we identified specific cell-to-cell interactions within the tumor cells. In conclusion, our study has led to the development of a comprehensive cell atlas, shedding light on the molecular characteristics and intricate interplay of immune cells within the TMEs of ACP and PCP."}, "GRANTS": {"GRANT": [{"grant_id": "21H02974 ", "TITLE": "Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) Fundamental research on age-related long non-coding RNAs in functional alterations associated with adipose and vascular tissue ageing.", "AGENCY": {"abbr": "JSPS", "content": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}}, {"grant_id": "19H03708", "TITLE": "Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B): Molecular pathological research on obesity and diabetes based on analysis of mitochondrial complexes and regulatory mechanisms", "AGENCY": {"abbr": "JSPS", "content": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}}, {"grant_id": "22300325", "TITLE": "Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) Regulation of chromatin function and iPS reprogramming by the p53 transcription factor complex.", "AGENCY": {"abbr": "JSPS", "content": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}}]}, "STUDY_LINKS": {"STUDY_LINK": [{"URL_LINK": {"LABEL": "https://www.m.chiba-u.ac.jp/class/moldiag/", "URL": "https://www.m.chiba-u.ac.jp/class/moldiag/"}}, {"URL_LINK": {"LABEL": "https://www.m.chiba-u.ac.jp/dept/neurosurgery/", "URL": "https://www.m.chiba-u.ac.jp/dept/neurosurgery/"}}]}, "STUDY_ATTRIBUTES": {"STUDY_ATTRIBUTE": [{"TAG": "NBDC Number", "VALUE": "hum0456"}, {"TAG": "Registration date", "VALUE": "2024-07-01"}, {"TAG": "Submitting organization", "VALUE": "Chiba University, Department of Molecular Diagnosis"}, {"TAG": "Principal Investigator", "VALUE": "Tomoaki Tanaka"}, {"TAG": "Molecular Data Type", "VALUE": "single-cell RNA sequence"}, {"TAG": "Platform", "VALUE": "NovaSeq 6000"}, {"TAG": "Vendor", "VALUE": "Illumina"}, {"TAG": "Comment", "VALUE": null}, {"TAG": "Primary Phenotype", "VALUE": "Craniopharyngioma"}, {"TAG": "Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria", "VALUE": "Diagnosed as craniopharyngioma in pathological diagnosis"}, {"TAG": "ICD-10 Disease Classification", "VALUE": "Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behaviour of endocrine glands: Craniopharyngeal duct (D44.4)"}, {"TAG": "disease", "VALUE": "craniopharyngioma"}, {"TAG": "method", "VALUE": "single-cell RNA sequence"}]}}}}
