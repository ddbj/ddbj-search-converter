Protocol Description	Pkd2l1-GCaMP3 mice were anesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with PBS. The larynx was dissected out, and its interior surface was exposed by a cut to the dorsal side. The laryngeal epithelium spanning from the supraglottis to subglottis epithelium was enzymatically peeled off by 20 min incubation, at room temperature, with a freshly prepared enzyme mixture (DNase I, 1 mg/ml; Dispase II, 16 U/ml; diluted in Tyrode's solution) injected underneath the epithelium. For selective isolation of taste bud cells, the peeled epithelium was incubated in the same enzyme mixture for 15 min and then in Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution for another 15 min. Hypopharyngeal taste buds, identified using GCaMP3 fluorescence under a fluorescent stereomicroscope SMZ25 (Nikon), were transferred by glass capillary pipette into 0.25% trypsin solution containing 1 mg/ml DNase I, and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 20 min, before being triturated into single cells with a glass capillary pipette. Alive isolated cells were sorted into a 96-well plate using a FACS MA900 (Sony Biotechnology) and were analyzed using a plate-based scRNA-seq Smart-seq3.	Smart-seq3 libraries were prepared following the Smart-seq3 Protocol V.3. with minor modifications. Briefly, 2.4 microliter of the lysis buffer [0.4 microliter of 10x Single-cell lysis buffer (TaKaRa Bio), 0.04 microliter of 40 U/ microliter RNasin Plus Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega), 0.02 microliter of 100 micromolar OligodT30VN and 1.94 microliter of nuclease-free water] was added to each well of 96-well plates. Then, dissociated cells were stained with 7-AAD (Nacalai tesque), and live single cells were sorted into the plate (one cell per well) using a cell sorter (MA900, Sony Biotechnology) and stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius until lysis and reverse transcription. The cells were lysed by incubation at 72 degrees Celsius for 5 min, then kept at 4 degrees Celsius. Next, reverse transcription was performed following the SMART-seq3 library protocol V.3 with 1.6 microliter of the reverse transcription master-mix [0.1 microliter of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 0.12 microliter of 1 M NaCl, 0.1 microliter of 100 mM MgCl2, 0.04 microliter of 100 mM GTP, 0.32 microliter of 100 mM DL-dithiothreitol, 0.05 microliter of 40 U/ microliter RNasin Plus Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega), 0.2 microliter of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.4 microliter of 50% Polyethylene Glycol 8000 solution, 0.08 microliter of 100 micromolar TSO (5'-biotin-AGAGACAGATTGCGCAATGNNNNNNNNrGrGrG-3'; IDT), 0.04 microliter of 200 U/ microliter Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.15 microliter of nuclease-free water] added to each well of 96-well plates.	After reverse transcription and PCR pre-amplification of full-length cDNA, 100 pg cDNA was followed by Tn5 tagmentation, and library amplification of the tagmented samples was performed using custom-designed Nextera index primers containing 8-bp indexes and Tks Gflex DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa Bio)	Library was sequenced using an MGI DNBSEQ G400RS platform with MGIEasy Universal Library Conversion Kit and DNBSEQ-G400RS High-throughput Sequencing Set (FCL PE100)	Raw files were processed with zUMIs v2.9.7 and STAR v2.7.8a. Briefly, reads were mapped onto a mouse genome (mm10).
