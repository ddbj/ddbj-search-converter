Protocol Name	P-GEAD-4602	P-GEAD-4603	P-GEAD-4604	P-GEAD-4605	P-GEAD-4606
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	nucleic acid library construction protocol	nucleic acid sequencing protocol	normalization data transformation protocol
Protocol Description	collected from mouse colon	using RNAiso plus and RNeasy mini kit	NEBNext ultra directional RNA library prep kit and NEBNext multipleps oligos for illumina	Novaseq 6000	The data obtained from RNA sequencing were trimmed with trimmomatic (v0.39) software to eliminate adapters and inadequate quality bases35, and FastQC (v0.11.8.-2) software was used for quality control of the trimmed sequence. The reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (NCBI GRCm39) using STAR software (v2.7.10a). To obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across all comparisons, the raw read counts were subjected to relative log expression normalization.
