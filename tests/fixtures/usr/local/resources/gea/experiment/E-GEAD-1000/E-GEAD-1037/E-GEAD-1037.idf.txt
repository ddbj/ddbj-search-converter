Investigation Title	Transitional Gene Expression Profiling of Ovarian Follicle in Rats Treated with Indomethacin and RU486 (CBX258)
Experiment Description	background: Single dosage on the proestrus day of indomethacin (IM, dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2) or RU486 (RU, progesterone receptor antagonist) can induce unruptured follicle (UF) in rats. However, the morphology of follicular epithelium is different, and those in IM-treated rats are close to normal corpus lutea, and those in RU-treated rats look like graafian follicle, i.e., theca cells and granulosa cells in IM-treated rats are larger than those in RU-treated rats, and the borderline between theca cell layer and granulosa cell layer is blurry in IM-treated rats, whereas it's distinct in RU-treated rats. In the previous study, we determined transitional gene expression profile of ovarian follicles in normal rats during ovulation. In the present study, we characterized the difference of gene expression profile between RU-treated and IM-treated rats. Materials and Methods: 21 female Crl:CD(SD) rats (8 weeks old) were used. Estrous phases of each animal was determined by vaginal smears for five consecutive days. RU (100 mg/kg) and IM (4 mg/kg) were orally administered at 10:00 and 15:00 on the proestrus day respectively, and ovaries were removed at 22:00 on the proestrus day and 10:00 on the estrus day, embedded in OCT compound and snapped frozen. Ovaries were also collected from untreated rats at 22:00 on the proestrus day, and 10:00 on the estrus day as a control. Each group consisted of three animals. Granulosa cell and theca cells of graafian follicle and peri-ovulatory follicle on the proestrus day, and post-ovulatory follicle were collected by Laser Micro Dissection technique, and total RNA was isolated from these follicles to be subjected to GeneChip (Affymetrix Rat 230.2.0 Array) analysis. Results and Discussion: Comparing transitional gene expression profiles of untreated rats with those of RU-treated and IM-treated rats, statistically significant changes of genes were identified.  In IM-treated rats, genes for hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein were down regulated, which may be related to insufficient follicle fluid production and seemed critical for rupture for follicles.  In RU-treated rats, many genes involved in lipid metabolism and steroid synthesis were affected, which is thought to correspond to immaturity of follicular cells. In addition, down-regulation of endothelin-2 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif 1 and 9 are observed, which were known to be indispensable for ovulation.  To analyze the difference of these profiles further, would make it possible to find genes or pathway which play important roles in the ovulatory impairment.

Protocol Description	Eight-week-old female Crl:CD(SD) rats were purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc. (Charles River Japan, Yokohama, Japan). All animals were housed in each metal cage in a barrier room with specific pathogen-free environment, at temperature of 22.4 to 23.8 degree C, with a relative humidity of 45 to 62 %, and a 12-h light-dark cycle. A standard commercial diet (CRF-1, Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and tap water were available ad libitum. After 1-week of acclimatization, estrous phases of each animal was determined by vaginal smears for five consecutive days. Animals were maintained and treated in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at our inistitution (AAALAC certified), and all animal experimental procedures were approved by the Committee for Animal Experiments of Astellas Pharma Inc., Ovaries were removed from 9-week old, normal rats at 10:00 p.m. on the proestrus day., Ovaries were removed from 9-week old, normal rats at 10:00 a.m. on the estrus day.	The ovaries were removed and embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), frozen in dry-ice-cold isopentan, and stored at -70 degree C until use. Frozen sections (8-micro-meter thick) were mounted on the membrane slides (MMI, Glatteburg, Zurich, Switzerland), and stained with HistogeneTM LCM frozen section staining kit (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA). Then, 15 follicles in each phase were cut by laser and picked up by LMD system (CellCut Plus?, MMI). The collected follicle sections were lysed by the buffer RLT in the collection tube supplied in RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)	In vitro transcription with IVT labeling kit(Affymetrix Inc.) generated multiple copies of biotin-labelled aRNA from the double-stranded cDNA templates.	Hybridization and following washing by fluidics were performed with hybridization, wash and stain kit(Affymetrix Inc.), in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction.	Gene chip  scanning was performed using gene chip scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).	1st normalization was performed for the median of all probe sets(31099 probe sets) per chip and 2nd normalization was performed for the 1st normalized value per gene by Gene Spring 7.3(Agilent technology.)., Image analysis were performed by MAS 5.0 with AGCC software(Affymetrix Inc.)., Statistical anlalysis(volcano plot analysis(welch t-test and 2 fold change)) and hierarchical analysis were performed by Gene Spring 7.3(Agilent technology.).	none	IM (Indomethacin, 17378, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and RU (Mifepristone, M8046, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were purchased, suspended in 0.5 % methylcellulose solution (Metlose?, SM-400, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) in concentrations of 20 mg/ml and 0.8 mg/ml respectively, and given at a volume of 5 ml/kg. Each dosage was selected according to two- or four-week repeated dose studies of IM (Tsubota et al. 2009) and RU (Tamura et al. 2009). IM and RU were singly administered orally at 16:00and 10:00, respectivily.
