Investigation Title	Gene expression profiling in the rat ileum exposed to methacryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride,benzyltrimethylammonium chloride,m-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt,1-naphthylamine-4-sulfonic acid sodium salt tetrahydrate, and 3-methoxy-3-methyl- (CBX164)
Experiment Description	Toxicology principally investigates the influence of chemical substances onto living organisms by use of biological indicators detected by experimental methods including biochemical, immunological, and pathological approaches that require method-specific multiple platforms.  In contrast, recently developed genomics enables to employ thousands of genes as parameters to assess diverse biological phenomena on a single platform such as gene expression profiling.  Thus, the integration of genomics into toxicology should exploit novel fields for the biological assessment of substances, describing alterations after exposure of substances to animals or cultured cells with multiple parameters in a single platform across diverse specimens.   In this study, we administered five chemical substances ?|2-butanone oxime, m-xylylenediamine, 3-cyanopyridine, 2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethanol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol?|independently to male for 28 days repeatedly, prepared multiple tissue samples of each animal, and comprehensively investigated gene expression levels in the jejunum with DNA microarrays containing probes representing approximately 11,000 species of rat transcripts.  We expect the data obtained in this study may contribute to establish novel accurate approaches for the assessment of chemical substances existing and generated in the future by comparing with the previously accumulated findings obtained by repeated dose 28-day oral administration to rats.

Protocol Description	none	The obtained solid organs were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and lysed with an ISOGEN reagent (NIPPON GENE). Total RNA was prepared from the lysate according to the manufacturer?fs instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA with a Poly(A)Purist Kit (Ambion, Tx, USA), according to the manufacturer?fs instructions.	Labeling, hybridization and subsequent washes of microarrays were performed with a Labeling &amp; Hybridization Kit (MicroDiagnostic), according to the manufacturer?fs instructions.	Hybridization and subsequent washes of arrays were performed with a Labeling and Hybridization Kit (MicroDiagnostic, Tokyo, Japan).	A set of synthetic polynucleotides (80-mers) representing 11,468 species of rat transcript sequences that are mostly originated from the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project clones deposited in the National Center for biotechnology Information (NCbI) database was purchased (MicroDiagnostic, Tokyo, Japan) and printed on a glass slide (coated glass slide for the microarray, type I; Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd., Kishiwada, Japan) with a custom-made arrayer., Hybridization signals were measured with a GenePix 4000b scanner (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA).	Measured hybridization signals were processed into primary expression ratios (ratios of cyanine 5 intensity of each sample to cyanine 3 intensity of the human common reference RNA) by the GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments Inc.)., Normalization was performed for each ratio by multiplying the normalization factors calculated by the GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments Inc.)., The primary expression ratios (ratios of cyanine 5 intensity of each sample to cyanine 3 intensity of the human common reference RNA) were converted into log2 values (designated as log ratios). To compare the cytokine-treated samples against the mock-treated samples (negative controls) for each cytokine, log ratios obtained for the mork-treated samples were subtracted from the log ratios obtained for each cytokine-treated sample(designated as relative log ratios).	Six-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory) were purchased and housed in a room maintained at 23???}2?? with 55%?}10% relative humidity, and lighting was maintained for 12 hr daily. All animals were allowed free access to commercial rodent chow, MF (Oriental Yeast Co.) and to tap water	Water for injection was orally administered daily to male Sprague-Dawley rats for 28 days., 2-butanone oxime was orally administered daily to male Sprague-Dawley rats at 100 mg/kg for 28 days., m-xylylenediamine was orally administered daily to male Sprague Dawley rats at 400 mg/kg for 28 days., 3-Cyanopyridine was orally administered daily to maleSprague Dawley rats at 180 mg/kg for 28 days., 2-(2-Aminoethylamino)ethanol was orally administered daily to male Sprague Dawley rats at 1000 mg/kg for 28 days, Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol was orally administered daily to male Sprague Dawley rats at 600 mg/kg for 28 days
