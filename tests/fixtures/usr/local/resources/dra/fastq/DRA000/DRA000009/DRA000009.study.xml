            <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>This is a metagenomic project to figure out the microbial community
            flourished along with hot water stream in the Japanese subsurface mine. As a first step
            of this project, we constructed a fosmid library from the DNA directly isolated from the
            microbial mat without cultivation. Since we could get about 3,500 fosmid clones, we
            determined the paired-end sequence of all fosmid clones. Next, we classified all clones
            in phylum level based on the information for the origin of the genes identified in the
            paired-end sequence and then we selected 179 clones evenly according to the ratio of
            each classified phylum to cover whole microbial community. These selected clones were
            sequenced by shotgun sequencing method (Sanger). Moreover, we selected 158 fosmid clones
            to increase the genomic information in the microbial mat and sequenced all the selected
            clones at once by 454 sequencer.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
