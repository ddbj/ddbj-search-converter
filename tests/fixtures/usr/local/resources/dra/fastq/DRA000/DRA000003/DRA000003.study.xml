            <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Comprehensive identification and characterization of the nucleosome
            structure in mammalian genes were attempted. We used Nucleosome-Seq method, in which
            next gene sequencing technology and micrococcus nuclease digestion assay were
            combined.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>

            <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>Although recent studies have revealed that the majority of human genes
            are subjected to regulation of alternative promoters (APs), the biological relevance of
            this phenomenon remains unclear. In order to understand biological significance of the
            presence of divergent transcription initiation events in the respective cell types, it
            is indispensable to obtain bird-view of the transcriptome figures at every step of the
            gene expression; namely, i) how the genomic structure change to transcriptionally active
            form, ii) where the transcription initiation complex is recruited, iii) to what extent
            the transcription is activated, iv) what transcripts formed and sorted to what
            subcellular fractions. We have recently started multi-faceted use of the Illumina GA to
            answer these questions. Integrative analysis produced for respective aspects of the gene
            expression regulations revealed the comprehensive figures of the complex human gene
            transcriptome for the first time.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
