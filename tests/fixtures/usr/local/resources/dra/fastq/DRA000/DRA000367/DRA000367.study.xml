            <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) has been isolated from cattle in Hokkaido, Japan since 2004. The resistance was mediated by CMY-2 I2-lactamase. The blaCMY-2 gene is typically located on a large plasmid; however the blaCMY-2 carrying plasmid was not detected from most of the isolates. These isolates showed indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern, designated as Clusteraï¾ã»-6, and exhibited resistant to seven antimicrobials in addition to ESCs. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the chromosomal integration of blaCMY-2 among the ST isolates showing PFGE pattern Clusteraï¾ã»-6 (ST-aï¾ã»-6). Genomic DNA of selected ST-aï¾ã»-6 isolates digested by I-CeuI and S1 nuclease were analyzed by Southern blotting using various probes. The blaCMY-2 signal was detected on 2.5 Mb fragment generated by the I-CeuI digestion, while absence of the signal on plasmids was confirmed by the S1 nuclease digestion. Results of sequencing analysis indicate that one of the ST-aï¾ã»-6 isolate possesses a unique 125-kb genomic island (GI), designated as GI-aï¾ã»-6, which is composed of 10 antimicrobial resistance genes in addition to blaCMY-2. A large proportion of GI-aï¾ã»-6 sequence was homologous to that of IncA/C plasmid pAR060302 from Escherichia coli origin. GI-aï¾ã»-6 includes two directly repeated IS26 copies in both ends. In addition, GI-aï¾ã»-6 is flanked by an 8-bp direct repeat suggesting the genomic island has been acquired through a transposition mediated by IS26 transposase. Results of PCR scanning of GI-aï¾ã»-6 of the other ST-aï¾ã»-6 isolates indicate that all the ST-aï¾ã»-6 isolates possess intact GI-aï¾ã»-6, with few exceptions. These results suggest that a unique clone, ST-aï¾ã»-6 harboring GI-aï¾ã»-6 has spread in the cattle population in Hokkaido, Japan.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
