growth_protocol:3T3-L1 cells were maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS. For adipocyte differentiation, two days after confluence, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with dexamethasone (1 uM), IBMX (0.5 mM), and insulin (5 ug/ml) (DMI) for 48 hours, followed by treatment with insulin alone, with medium replacement every two days thereafter.</DESCRIPTION>
