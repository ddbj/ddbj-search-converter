            <STUDY_ABSTRACT>small RNA cDNA library was made and read by deep sequencing.
cross-mapping procedure was applied 
miRNA pofiling of male rat hippocampal CA3 was performed by deep sequencing. 
The hippocampus is a part of the brain critically involved in memory formation and spatial navigation. 
Shinohara et al. (2011,) used deep sequencing for microRNA (miRNA) profiling of multiple samples of 
the mature male rat hippocampal CA3 region. According to their study, the let-7 family miRNA represents about 
half of the small RNA cDNA library. Major let-7 family miRNAs are let-7c (23%), let-7a (9%), let-7f (9%), and let-7b (7%).
The authors found miR134, a miRNA previously reported to be related to synaptic plasticity and morphology, 
only modestly expressed (~0.05%). The miRNA profiles of the left and right hippocampi were similar. 
The sequence data derived from 3 pooled data sets and each data set contained corresponding left and right 
hippocampal CA3 samples. This study is one of the fewest studies in which miRNA expression profiles were quantitatively 
assessed in a specific region of the brain.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
