      <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The 4.5 Mb genome of a clinical isolate of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A was completely sequenced using capillary techniques and subsequently checked using Illumina/Solexa re-sequencing. Annotation and sequence comparison with other serovar Paratyphi A and Typhi genomes identified several pseudogenes that had been overlooked in prior genome annotations, and showed that 66 pseudogenes are common to both serovars by virtue of conservation (38), recent recombination (6) and independent mutation (22), highlighting distinct mechanisms that may have contributed to the phenotypic convergence of these genetically distinct human-restricted pathogens.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
