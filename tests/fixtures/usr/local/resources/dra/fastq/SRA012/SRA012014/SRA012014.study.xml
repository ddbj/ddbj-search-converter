      <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) at the National Cancer Institute sponsored a series of studies as part of the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) to assess novel emerging sequencing technologies in cancer. The CGCI program included comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors. CGCI characterized a number of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and adult and pediatric Burkitt lymphomas). All data from these projects is available at the NCI Genomic Data Commons. In combination, the lymphoid cancers (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), constitute the fourth most common malignancy in both men and...
