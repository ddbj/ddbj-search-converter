Protocol Description	Jatropha curcas are grown in an open experimental field at the University of the Ryukyus (Okinawa island, Okinawa, Japan), located in a subtropical area. Methanol [for HPLC Solvent] solution was used for blank sample.	Harvested sample is frozen by liquid N2 and ground to powder by a homogenizer, Shake Master (Biomedical Science, Tokyo, Japan). The powdered sample (100mg) are solved in 300 microL 80% methanol solution. 10 microL sample is injected into HPLC after 0.2 micrometre membrane filter treatment.

The replicates data are aligned by PowerMatch with blank data. The alignment is manually edited. Assigned peaks observed in multiple replicate samples are selected for annotation process.	In annotation process, KEGG, KNApSAcK and LipidMAPS are used for primary database search. Peaks with no hit to these databases are then selected to secondary search using exactMassDB and Pep1000 databases. After the database search processes, each database hits are manually checked to assign a compound name or compound category name. In case of no compound name or compound category name can assign, predicted molecular formulas are used for the annotation. Peaks without predicted molecular formula are assigned as "unidentified" peak.
