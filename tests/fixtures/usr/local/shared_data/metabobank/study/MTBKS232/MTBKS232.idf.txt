Study Title	The Gut Microbiota Impairs Early Salmonella Colonization by Limiting Amino Acid Catabolism
Study Description	The gut microbiota confers host protection by limiting the colonization of pathogenic bacteria early after infection. Several mechanisms underlying the protection afforded by the microbiota have been described, but the relative contributions of nutrient competition versus direct inhibition are controversial. Using a newly developed ex vivo model of Salmonella colonization in the mouse cecum containing indigenous microbes, we found that inhibitory compounds are less important than nutrient limitation for inhibiting pathogen colonization.  Specifically, we found that addition of certain amino acids depleted by the microbiota, but not glucose, markedly reversed the inhibitory effect afforded by the microbiota. A genetic screen and mutational studies in Salmonella revealed that amino acids are catabolized by the pathogen and the utilization of these critical metabolic pathways are impaired by the presence of the gut microbiota. Thus, limitation of the ability of Salmonella to catabolize amino acids is an essential part of early colonization resistance.

Protocol Description	"SPF mice on the C57BL/6 background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred under SPF conditions in our mouse facility at the University of Michigan. All mice were maintained on the conventional rodent chow 5L0D (LabDiet). Mice were sex and age-matched, and bedding was mixed between cages 2-3 times before beginning the experiment to homogenize the gut microbiota. All animal studies were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Care and Use of Animals.
Salmonella enterica subspecies Enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.Tm) was grown overnight in LB with appropriate antibiotics, shaking at 37degree, then diluted 1:50 and shaken 2.5 h in fresh LB. These cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in approximately one volume PBS but adjusted to equal densities according to their OD600.
For the streptomycin-treatment expetiments, mice were gavaged with 20 mg streptomycin in 100 microL water 24 hours before dissection. Intestinal contents from mice were collected and frozen at minus 80 degree until use."

For the ex vivo experiments, mice were euthanized by isoflurane or CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation and removal of the cecum to a petri dish, which was immediately transferred into an anaerobic chamber. The cecum was opened and contents squeezed into pre-reduced ultrapure water, and vortexed and pipetted to homogenize. This was passed through a 100 µm filter to remove large debris, and either left whole and incubated 12 h, or 0.45 micrometer filtered and froze it, or incubated the filtrate for 12 h, or added S.Tm to the filtrate and incubated for 12 h. To separate the supernatant from pelletable material, these were centrifuged for 10 min at 21,300 x g, supernatant 0.45 micrometer filtered. There were stored at -80°C until extraction."

For the streptomycin and diet experiments,  mice were placed on the protein-adjusted diets at the time of streptomycin gavage, and 24 h later, infected with ~10-50 CFU S. Tm in 100 microL. After 24h at infection, mice were euthanized and removal of the cecum to a petri dish. The cecum was opened and contents squeezed into pre-reduced ultrapure water, and vortexed and pipetted to homogenize.

There were stored at -80°C until extraction."	10 mg of freeze-dried intestine contents were mixed with 500 microL methanol, whereas 50 microL filtrate samples were mixed with 450 microL methanol. There were homogenized in a Shake Master NEO machine (Bio Medical Science Inc.) using 100mg 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads and four 3mm zirconia beads (Tomy Seiko CO.,LTD). 200 microL of Milli-Q water supplemented with 200 microM methionine sulfone as well as 200 microM D-camphor-10-sulfonic acid and 500 microL of chloroform were added to the mixtures and samples were shaken again. Samples were centrifuged (20,000 x g, 10 min) at 4 degree, the obtained supernatant were transferred to a filter column with a 5 kDa cut-off (Ultrafree MC-PLHCC 250/pk, Human Metabolome Technologies) for metabolite analysis. The resulting flow-through was dried with centrifugal concentrator (Labconco Corp.) at 40 degree 3hours. 50 microL of Milli-Q water containing reference compounds (200 microM 3-aminopyrrolidine and 200 microM trimesic acid) was used to dissolve the residue.	"Extracted metabolites were separated by an Agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) in positive mode.
A fused silica capillary (Molex Inc.) was used as the separation capillary. A 1 M formic acid solution was used as electrolyte solution for CE separation. Approximately 5 nl of sample solution were injected at 50 mbar for 5 seconds, and 30 kV of voltage was applied. The capillary temperature was maintained at 20 degree, and the sample tray was cooled below 5 degree."	"Extracted metabolites were diluted  5 times with Milli-Q water and separated by an Agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) in negative mode.
A COSMO(+) capillary (Nacalai Tesque, Inc) was used as the separation capillary. A 50 mM ammonium acetate solution (pH 8.5) was used as electrolyte solution for CE separation. Approximately 30 nl sample solution was injected at 50 mbar for 30 seconds and -30 kV of voltage was applied. The capillary temperature was maintained at 20 degree and the sample tray was cooled below 5 degree."	"The levels of extracted metabolites were measured by the Agilent 62xx time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) in positive mode.
Methanol-water (50% v/v) containing 0.01 microM Hexakis(2,2-difluoroethoxy)phosphazene was delivered as the sheath liquid at 10 microL/min. ESI-TOFMS was operated in the positive ion mode, and the capillary voltage was set at 4,000 V. A flow rate of heated dry nitrogen gas (heater temperature 300 gegree) was maintained at 7 psig. In TOFMS, the fragmentor, skimmer, and Oct RFV voltage were set at 75 V, 50 V, and 500 V, respectively. Automatic recalibration of each acquired spectrum was performed using reference masses of reference standards. The methanol adduct ion (m/z 66.063061) and Hexakis(2,2-difluoroethoxy)phosphazene (m/z 622.028963) provided the lock mass for exact mass measurements. Exact mass data were acquired at a rate of 10 spectra/s over a 50-1,000 m/z range."	The levels of extracted metabolites were measured by the Agilent 62xx time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) in negative mode. Ammonium acetate (5 mM) in 50% methanol-water (v/v) containing 0.1 nicroM Hexakis(2,2-difluoroethoxy) phosphazene was delivered as the sheath liquid at 10 microL/min. ESI-TOFMS was conducted in the negative ion mode; the capillary voltage was set at 3,500 V. For TOFMS, the fragmentor, skimmer, and Oct RFV voltage were set at 100 V, 50 V, and 200 V, respectively. Automatic recalibration of each acquired spectrum was performed using reference masses of standards. 2CH3COOH13C isotope (m/z 120.038339) and Hexakis(2,2-difluoroethoxy)phosphazene+CH3COOH (m/z 680.035541) provided the lock mass for exact mass measurements. Exact mass data were acquired at a rate of 10 spectra/s over a 50-1,000 m/z range.	Raw data were analyzed with an in-house software called MasterHands.	The peaks were identified with an in-house software called MasterHands, based on the matched m/z values and normalized migration times of the corresponding standard compounds if available. Of the peaks that did not match with any standard compounds, the concomitant peaks, such as isotopic peaks and fragment peaks, were removed based on the difference in m/z values and the normalized migration time of the two peaks with an error tolerance of 20 ppm and 0.01 min to yield only the peaks, or referred to as components, which might be derived from metabolites. Here, we used compounds available from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomics (KEGG) databaseand the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) as candidates. The composition formulae obtained using the measured mass spectrometry and the matched candidates were confirmed by their isotope distribution patterns.
