Study Title	Identification of lipid components of royal food and midgut content of various castes in a termite
Study Description	To reveal lipid components of king food, queen food, and midgut contents of kings, queens, soldiers and workers, they were collected directly from each other, and then we analyzed lipid profiles of them by using  LC-MS/MS analysis.

Protocol Description	"Royal food collection: we opened the window of the glass cell at the moment the worker started feeding the king or queen, pinched the feeding worker between the head and thorax with forceps, and immediately collected the food directly from between the feeding worker's mandibles, labrum, and labium using a picker.
Midgut content collection: The digestive tract of the termite individual was removed under a microscope into phosphate-buffered saline and the midgut and hindgut were separated using forceps. During separation, the midgut side of the resection surface was held between the forceps to prevent the release of midgut contents into the PBS. Next, the resection surface of the midgut was dipped into the buffer for chemical analyses, and the contents were collected by gently pressing the midgut with forceps."	Samples were directly injected into a column in LC-MS/MS	Liquid chromatography was performed on an UltiMate 3000 (Thermofisher Scientific). An Acclaim 120 C18 column (2.1 mm i.d. × 150 mm, 3 µm, Thermofisher Scientific) was used for the chromatographic separation of a termite extract. The analysis conditions were follows; a mobile phase flow rate was 0.3 mL/min, a column temperature was 50 °C, the mobile phase was composed of A (water/acetonitrile/methanol=2/1/1, 5 mM ammonium formate,   0.1% formic acid) and B (acetonitrile/2-propanol=1/9, 5 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid) with a linear gradient elution: B=20% (0 min) - 100% (50 min) - 100% (60 min). The sample injection volume was 1 µL.	Mass spectrometry was perfomed on a Q-Exactive (quadrupole-Orbitrap MS, Thermofisher Scientific) equipped with a heated ESI source after liquid chromatography. A Q-Exactive was operated in mass resolution of 70,000 (FWHM) for mass spectra and 17,500 (FWHM) for product ion spectra with a spray voltage of 3.5 kV(+)/2.5 kV(-), and a S-lens RF level was set to 50. The sheath gas and the auxiliary gas flow rate were set to 50 and 15 L/h, respectively. The capillary temperature and the heater temperature were set to 250 °C and 350 °C, respectively. The mass spectra by MS/MS were recorded in a profile mode from m/z 220-2000. The MS/MS was carried out by a data dependent acquisition mode with an intensity threshold of 5.0e4. The collision energy for MS/MS was set to 30 eV.	We used QualBrowser software contained in Xcalibur 4.4 software, UNIX commands, mzMine ver. 2.53 software, and R software 4.0 software to discover the lipids that unevenly distributed in king food or queen food, or among midgut contents of king, queen, soldiers and workers.
